## Summons to Love

*By William Henry Drummond*

Phoebus, arise! <br>
And paint the sable skies<br>
With azure, white, and red:<br>
Rouse Memnon’s mother from her Tithon’s bed<br>
That she may thy career with roses spread:<br>
The nightingales thy coming each-where sing:<br>
Make an eternal spring!<br>
Give life to this dark world which lieth dead;<br>
Spread forth thy golden hair<br>
In larger locks than thou wast wont before,<br>
And emperor-like decore<br>
With diadem of pearl thy temples fair:<br>
Chase hence the ugly night<br>
Which serves but to make dear thy glorious light.<br>

This is that happy morn,<br>
That day, long-wished day,<br>
Of all my life so dark,<br>
(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn,<br>
And fates my hopes betray),<br>
Which, purely white, deserves<br>
An everlasting diamond should it mark.<br>
This is the morn should bring unto this grove<br>
My Love, to hear and recompense my love.<br>
Fair King, who all preserves,<br>
But show thy blushing beams<br>
And thou two sweeter eyes<br>
Shalt see than those which by Peneus’ streams<br>
Did once thy heart surprise.<br>
Now, Flora, deck thyself in fairest guise:<br>
If that ye winds would hear<br>
A voice surpassing far Amphion’s lyre,<br>
Your furious chiding stay;<br>
Let Zephyr only breathe,<br>
And with her tresses play.<br>
The winds all silent are,<br>
And Phoebus in his chair<br>
Ensaffroning sea and air<br>
Makes vanish every star:<br>
Night like a drunkard reels<br>
Beyond the hills, to shun his flaming wheels:<br>
The fields with flowers are decked in every hue,<br>
The clouds with orient gold spangle their blue;<br>
Here is the pleasant place,<br>
And nothing wanting is, save She, alas!<br>
